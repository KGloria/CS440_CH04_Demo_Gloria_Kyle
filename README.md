# CS440_CH04_Demo_Gloria_Kyle

I chose the GNU General Public License 3.0 because it is a fairly strong license using the concept of copyleft. 
Under this the developer copyrights on the program allow modification and distribution of the works and any program
developed from it as long as the same conditions are applied to the new work. I chose this licesnse because while it lets any 
work I create to be reused, I can set the terms of how it can be used and those copyrights and agreements will carry over.
